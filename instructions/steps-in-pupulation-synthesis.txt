So far what I understand from reading a few papers about constructing synthetic 
population, there are four core steps in the construction process:

1. Population Synthesis:
In the first step, one uses census data from his target area (nation, state, 
region) and some representative sample data within that target area then applies
iterative proportional fitting to determine the joint destribution of the 
population from marginal totals found in the census data using the sample data
as the seed for IPF initialization.

After the joint distribution is estimated then some sampling technology is used
to sample the desired number of households and individuals from the sample data.
In this case sampling with replacement is done and emphasis is given on 
maintaining that the demographic statistic of the synthetic population respect
both the representative sample used as seed and that of the joint distribution.

In constructing the synthetic population of the United States or any of its 
regions, we should use the American Community Survey data for marginal totals 
and  the PUMA data that is also a part of the census for our region of interest 
as both seed for IPF and source for synthetic household sampling.

2. Location Assignment:
At this step, real individuals (without any identifying information) are assigned
to the synthetic individuals in the synthetic households based on travel data. In
the case of synthetic population construction of United States, National 
Household travel survey is being used. A regression technique is used to determine
the closest matching synthetic household with real world household based on 
maximum person-to-person distance between the individuls in the real and synthetic
household. 

I need to read more about this process and investigate the travel data to better 
inderstand how this step is conducted.


3. Activity Assignment:


4. Interaction Estimation/Tracking:
