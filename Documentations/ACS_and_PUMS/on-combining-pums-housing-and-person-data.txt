According to the information provided in ACS2015_2019_PUMS_README.pdf file, the  serial number 
attribute in both housing and person record puma files can be used as the merge key for combining 
household level attributes with person level attributes (read Page 10 of that PDF file to verify
the case). However, note that some caution must be applied when merging the two files as the 
housing file contains vacant housing records for which no person level record should be found in 
the person file. Also remember that, after merging what we get is a person records file where 
housing related information of the person are attached with sample person.
